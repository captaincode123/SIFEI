This document covers the installation of SIF and SIFEI. After installation, an end-user should be able to
run SIFEI. This guide assumes that you have binary builds of SIF and SIFEI available. You can get binaries
of the demo which we showcased at EuSpRIG 2014 from our FTP site:

ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/se/sifei_eusprig2014.zip

If you want to build SIF and SIFEI yourself see the document BUILD

System requirements:

- Computer with x86 or x86_64 architecture (or a virtual machine)
- Microsoft Windows 7 or 8.x
- Microsoft Excel 2013
- Oracle Java Runtime Environment 1.6 or higher
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5
- Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime (vstor_redist.exe, available at 
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=42513 )

Other environments *might* work but have not been tested. Below are the steps for a sample installation:

First, we install the environment:

1.) Install Windows 8.1 (tested with enterprise 64 and 32bits)
2.) Install Java Runtime Environment (tested with 1.7u60 and 1.8u5)
3.) Install Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus
4.) Install Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime

We skipped the following, because Windows 8.1 already includes them and Java path configuration is done by the
installer (the .NET 4.5 runtime is required for Windows 7 though, also some Java installers fail with setting 
the paths):

5.) Add java to your PATH environment variable
6.) Install .NET Framework 4.5

Now we can install the SIF and SIFEI distribution (this assumes the artifacts have been built already):

1.) Copy Folder "Spreadsheet Inspection Framework" to C:\ 
   (blanks are required and the path is hardcoded currently, sorry!)
2.) Run setup.exe in SIFEI-Installer folder
